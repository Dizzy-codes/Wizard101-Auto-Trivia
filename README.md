# Wizard101-Auto-Trivia

## Use
This is a program that will automatically answer Wizard101 trivia; it currently can solve all the Trivia that relate **specifically** to Wizard101. The program uses Selenium to interact with the web page, you can add more QA of different trivia in the Dictionary if you want more options (it can already solve up to 10 quizes).
##
>Will this automatically do all 10 at once?
**No**. After it solves a quiz, you need to complete the captcha at the end to reciceve the crowns. Then, go to the next to quiz and press enter into the screen prompt.

>How long does the program take to solve each question?
**5 seconds**. The program has to wait for each question to load, then it clicks the correct answer and waits 1 second before going to the next question. It has some intential delays so that it seems more human and does not spam the webpage with requests.

>I got a keyerror when running the program, what should I do?
This error may show up if values in the dictionary are wrong; if Kingsisle updates the questions with newer ones, the dictionary will need to be updated. I will keep updating the dictionary if needed.

>Is this the same thing as the trivia bot that got people in trouble?
**Not really.** This program was made to seem human and doesn't run via an extension. It also doesn't solve captchas, so this program is slightly less practacle; however, it's more on the DL and will save you a lot of time!

>I have an idea to improve the bot, can I help?
**Sure.** I will take suggestions, message me on Discord (**Dizzy#9275**)
